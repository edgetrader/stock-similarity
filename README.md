# Stock Similarity and Comparison through Dimensionality Reduction and Visualisation

## Summary
This analysis aims to identify companies with factors that are different from their peers in the same industry. However, one has to deal with many factors and very often not all of them are representative or are useful in clustering companies of similar qualities and attributes.

We use t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding) algorithm here to reduce these complexity, visualise how companies in different industries are clustered and identify companies that are fundamentally different from others.

## Data
This analysis was first created and written on [JoinQuant](https://www.joinquant.com/) research platform.  Data were gathered using [JQData API](https://www.joinquant.com/data).
